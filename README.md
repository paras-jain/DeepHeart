# DeepHeart

 DeepHeart is a neural network designed for the [2016 Physionet Challenge](http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2016/) in predicting
 cardiac abnormalities from phonocardiogram (PCG) data. The challenge
 provides heart recordings from several patients labeled as normal
 or abnormal. It is difficult to predict patient health from PCG data 
 because of noise from several sources: talking, breathing, intestinal 
 sounds, etc.
 
 To combat the excessive amount of noise and relatively small sample size, 
 a convolutional neural network is trained using Google's [Tensorflow](http://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). Tensorflow provides an easy to use interface 
 for compiling and efficiently running neural networks. 
 
 Ideally the raw wav files would be fed into a very deep Tensorflow
 network and, with some careful regularization, the model would learn 
 to accurately separate signal from noise. To reduce the cost of
 training, the number of hidden units is reduced in favor of
 some old school feature engineering: the fast fourier transform (FFT). 
 The FFT is a signal processing technique for converting a signal into
 a frequency domain. The original signal is also filtered with a high
 pass Butterworth filter aimed at removing noise above 4Hz (or 240 beats
 per minute). The filtered signal is again transformed to it's approximate
 frequency domain. A combination of the above fourier coefficients are 
 fed into the convolutional neural network.
 
# Installing

To run, set up a virtual environment (ensure python2.7, virtualenv, and 
pip are in your PATH)

```
>> cd deepheart
>> virtualenv env
>> source env/bin/activate
>> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the physionet dataset 

```
>> wget http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/challenge/2016/training.zip
>> unzip training.zip
```

Install tensorflow from [Tensorflow's site](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation) 
(pip install recommended)

Build a feature vector from the raw data and train the CNN
```
>> python deepheart/train_model.py <path_to_physionet_data> <do load previously saved data>
e.g.,
>> python deepheart/train_model.py training/ f
```

Note: by default this saves tensorboard statistics to /tmp which can
be launched using
```
>> tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/train
```

# Performance
Currently physionet data is scoring using the mean of sensitivity and
specificity (Fraction of True positives and True Negatives). These summaries
are calculated and logged in tensorboard as well as printed to terminal.

Currently, the tensorflow CNN model converges to a mean score of
 0.78.
